# Your own project

Build an app of your choice.

- You are free to use any technologies covered so far. You are welcome to try new technologies you find interesting.
- Keep it simple. Aim to get the basic functionality working on day one. You can then extend it on days two and three.
- Feel free to use an external API to provide additional functionality to your app. Avoid APIs that use complex authentication mechanisms.
- Use pen and paper to draw a diagram of the webpage layout before starting to code. Have a think about what components you will need in advance.
- Think about how to organise your data in advance
- Make sure your app is responsive
- Commit frequently
- Create pull request at the end
- Keep it simple
